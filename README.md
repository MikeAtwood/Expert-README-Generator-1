# Expert-README-Generator-1

 Decription:
  Using Node.js you can generate a personal user README file that is well structured and quick to use. You are prompted with several Key questions that
  will then be transferred to your new README file!
  AS A developer:
  - I WANT a README generator
  - SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project


  GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
  WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
  THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, 
  Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
  WHEN I enter my project title
  THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
  WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
  THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
  WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
  THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains 
  which license the application is covered under
  WHEN I enter my GitHub username
  THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
  WHEN I enter my email address
  THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
  WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
  THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README


  ## Installation:
  Install by downloading the 'Zip File' or by cloning the SSH Key into Terminal, GitBash, or any console/command line of your choosing. Install Node
  Package Manager using 'node install' or 'node i' and wait for the download to complete! (This only takes a minute, so don't worry!)

  ## Usage:
  Once you have npm, or 'Node Package Manager' downloaded, open up your command line (either on desktop or vs code integrated command line) and type 'node
  index' to start the process.
